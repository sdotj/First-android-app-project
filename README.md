# First-android-app

## DUE: 23 Jan 2020

You have read all of Chapter 3 by now. There were many steps to test a development environment. You will perform these steps in this assignment. There are two major sections to Chapter 3, **Testing Your Development Environment** and **Building Your First Android Application**. 

## TODO:

Take screenshots at various points to demonstrate that you have completed the various sections of the assignment. Your repository should be called "First-android-app-\<yourLastName\> and create a directory called 'screenshots'. Place all of your screenshots there and commit/push to GitHub. You can push the code you create as well, but it is not necessary. 

Update: The borderless buttons example that the textbook discusses is nowhere to be found.  Instead, I just created a HelloWorld application to test my development environment.  I included a directory called screenshots where screenshots of the process can be found.
